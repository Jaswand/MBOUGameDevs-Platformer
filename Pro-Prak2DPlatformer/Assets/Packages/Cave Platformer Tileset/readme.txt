---OVERALL NOTES---

There are 3* folders: 
- sprite sheet for the enviroment tiles and objects
- sprite sheet for a monster character
- example layers that you can combine to create an example stage (also serves as reference for how to connect the tiles)

*Updated 2017. 01. 07.
- Added a new 4th folder, content is the same, only the storeage is different: you can find every frame as individual images in the "Individual PNG files" folder.

The sheets are all transparent pngs, plus you'll find a .gal file in the example sheets folder. You can open this file using GrahicsGale. This file serves as an example, it basicly contains the tiles and background that you get in this pack.

---ENVIROMENT SPRITE SHEETS---

Each sheet contains differenct background elements.

The order of the layers should be from sky (bottom) to objects (top).

In the "Example stage layers" you can see how it would look like. The number in the name of the sheets indicates the order. If there's a G or B letter at the end of the name, it indicates a color variation (do not use both at the same time).

The "Enviroment sprite sheets" folder contains the following (listing from bottom to top layer):
1-3. parallax_bg_set.png
On this sheet you find 4 background layers and some color variatons. From top to bottom: sky, mountains, hills (color variant 1), hills (color variant 2), cliffs (color variant 1), cliffs (color variant 2).

4. parallax_cave_tops.png, parallax_bg_cave_blueish.png, parallax_bg_cave_greenish.png
From these sheets you can build a background layer.

1 to 4 layers are loopable and can be used as parallax background.

5. bg_cave_ ... .png files
From these tiles you can make another background layer. Should be static.

6. bg_objects.png, water_animated.png, watertile.png, and tree-...png files
Objects for the background.

7. cave_tileset.png
Tiles of the rocky enviroment in 2 color variations plus underwater tiles.

8. objects_ ... .png
Foreground objects, some are animated (campfire, chests, fountains, spikes)

---MONSTER ANIMATIONS NOTES---

List of the animations from up to down (1 line = 1 animation):
- idle
- walk

If you like this monster, you can find more on my unity page (2D Animated Monster Pack asset).

In the end, I hope you find the pack useful, and I wish you good luck with your projects!
